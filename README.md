# Photorename

Photorename Small GUI wrapper around [ExifTool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) to help with the specific task of helping rename photos based on their date and time taken.

I coded Photorename back around 2010 as a project to learn Python. I recently decided to reintegrate it to my photo management workflow and share it.

## Known issue

- It only support the Windows version of ExifTool for now. I plan to add Linux and OSX support in future commits.
- ExifTool installation is not working properly and will need to be updated to conform to the current download page format.
